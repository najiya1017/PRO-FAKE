# PRO-FAKE
In today's digital landscape, the proliferation of fake social media profiles on platforms like 
Instagram presents a significant challenge. Current methods for detecting these deceptive accounts 
are proving insufficient in keeping pace with the evolving tactics of fraudsters. Consequently, 
there is a pressing need to develop more advanced and effective approaches to distinguish 
between genuine and fake profiles specifically on Instagram.
The aim is to develop a hybrid model that combines traditional machine learning (ML) techniques 
with state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) approaches. By leveraging the strengths of both 
methodologies, the goal is to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of detecting fake social media 
profiles on Instagram, thereby mitigating the spread of misinformation and identity deception 
online. The inadequacies seen in current methods for detecting fake social media profiles will be 
addressed by introducing a hybrid approach that blends machine learning (ML) and deep learning 
(DL) techniques. This fusion aims to create a stronger defense against online deceit and ensure the 
trustworthiness of the Instagram platform
